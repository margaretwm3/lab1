				<li>Description: A game developed from scratch with a group of 7 people for <i>CSE 125: Software System Design and Implementation</i>. It is a 3D multiple-user game. The idea is to build your own battle block using all the weapons you could purchase and fight with other 3 users, at the same time collect the money in the battle field. The player with the least of number of deaths wins the game.</li>
